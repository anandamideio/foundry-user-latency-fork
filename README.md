# Unmaintained, please direct all requests to the ticket on Foundry's repo below

I do not really use Foundry anymore and was really just holding this until it was implemented into Foundry natively. It's a very low effort feature that is important to users and there is realistically no reason it's not already a native feature.

I have created a ticket on the Foundry Repo, which you can find here: https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/11132

The more tracking that post gets, the more likely it will be added.
